<h1>ABOUT</h1>
<p><div>The district has 14 police stations and covers an area of about 340,447 hectares (841,260 acres), Geographically, the district can be divided into two parts viz. (i) Hilly area and (ii) Plain area. The district has close linkage with the history of Shahabad, which was its parent district also. The old district of Shahabad had four subdivisions of which Bhabua was one. The present district of Kaimur has been formed from the whole of this Bhabua subdivision. The District of Bhabua is divided in wards e.g. Ward 6 for Gavai ward 12 near Patel chowk etc., all wards have a ward commissioner who looks after the welfare and civic affairs of the ward and the head of all the ward commissioner's is elected amongst themselves who is called the chairman. The nearest big city is Varanasi which is 70 km from here and we have buses every half an hour running to and from.</u></div></p>
